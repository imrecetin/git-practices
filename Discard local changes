Discard local changes
So, here is a case where I modified the ‘README’ file and staged it. Next, I modified the same file a second time but realized that I didn’t want the second change.

Now, let me not undo the entire change manually, I can simply pull the staged version of the file.
Syntax:
git checkout -- <filename> –local changes in a file
git checkout -- <dirname> –local changes in all the files in the directory­­

Command: git checkout -- README

So, I discarded my last changes to the file and accepted the staged version of the file.
