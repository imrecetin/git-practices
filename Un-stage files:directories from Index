Un-stage files/directories from Index

While adding and/or modifying files you often tend to use the default behavior of ‘git add’ command, which is to add all files and directories to the Index. Many a time you feel the need to un-stage certain files or modify them one last time before committing them.

Syntax: git reset <filename/dirname>
		git reset HEAD <filename/dirname>
