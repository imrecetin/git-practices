Committed personal data to the local repository
I want to remove certain data from the local repository but keep the files in the working directory.
Syntax:
git reset --mixed HEAD~
git reset --mixed <commit-id>

Command: git reset --mixed HEAD~1
HEAD~1 indicates a commit just before the recent commit pointed by the current branch HEAD.

Files in the current snapshot removed from both the local repository and the staging area.
